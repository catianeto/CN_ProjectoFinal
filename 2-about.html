    <h2 class="about-subtitle">Welcome to my little corner on the web</h2>
    <p>I started working as a graphics designer in 2010, after getting my BA in Communication Design. 
        After a couple of years working mainly for events and exhibitions, I began focusing my work on branding and visual identity, an area that has been core for the past six years. 
        Over the last year I've been taking the first steps working as a UI/UX designer, bringing all the knowledge and experience in visual design as well as consistent and meaningful brand communication to every project I work on.</p>
